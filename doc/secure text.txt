for app:
	w3af -- (Python, supports plugins)

for coding:

	code review based on security rule
	thread safe
	no memory leaks


	tools to plugin into IDE
	Sonar
	FindSecurityBugs
	LAPSE
	PMD -- source code analyzer (https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.4.0/index.html)

	need to investigate to see which one is the best
	
	
	
Principal

1.	source code analyser IDE/maven plug-in
	Target:
	follow Java secure coding guideline

	Benefit: 
	find potential issue at the earliest stage
	guarantee security from source code level
	save vast amount of code review time
	big help for developers of all levels
	
	Cost:
	open source projects for free
	(consider commercials if it's better?)
	no extra development time
	build with projects by maven plug-in
	
	Open source tools candidates:
	OWASP LAPSE+
	Google CodePro Analytix
	Find Security Bugs
	OWASP Orizon Project(code review tool)
	
	todo:
	more research to find which one to be used

2. 	Testing
	Target:
	thread, memory(leak, high usage), CPU safe

	Benefit:
	performance
	robust
	reduce maintenance cost
   
    Cost:
	open source / commercial tools
	self development(developers known more details)
   
3. 	Authentication & Authorization & Audit
	Benefit:
	Guarantee runtime security
	Provide well grained access control
	Monitor, trace and analysis system users and resources
	
	Target:
	Configurable
	Plug-able
	Implement with standard protocols
	
	Cost:
	Dedicated module/service development and maintenance
	Open source / commercial implementation
