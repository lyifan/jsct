for app:
	w3af -- (Python, supports plugins)

for coding:

	code review based on security rule
	thread safe
	no memory leaks


	tools to plugin into IDE
	Sonar
	FindSecurityBugs
	LAPSE
	PMD -- source code analyzer (https://pmd.github.io/pmd-5.4.0/index.html)

	need to investigate to see which one is the best
	
	
	
Principal

1.	source code analyser IDE/maven plug-in
	Target:
	follow Java secure coding guideline

	Benefit: 
	find potential issue at the earliest stage
	guarantee security from source code level
	save vast amount of code review time
	big help for developers of all levels
	
	Cost:
	open source projects for free
	(consider commercials if it's better?)
	no extra development time
	build with projects by maven plug-in
	
	Open source tools candidates:
	OWASP LAPSE+
	Google CodePro Analytix
	Find Security Bugs
	OWASP Orizon Project(code review tool)
	
	todo:
	more research to find which one to be used

2. 	Testing
	Target:
	thread, memory(leak, high usage), CPU safe

	Benefit:
	performance
	robust
	reduce maintenance cost
   
    Cost:
	open source / commercial tools
	self development(developers known more details)
   
3. 	Authentication & Authorization & Audit
	Benefit:
	Guarantee runtime security
	Provide well grained access control
	Monitor, trace and analysis system users and resources
	
	Target:
	Configurable
	Plug-able
	Implement with standard protocols
	
	Cost:
	Dedicated module/service development and maintenance
	Open source / commercial implementation
	
Why spring security
1. Well designed framework, easy to configure, customize and extend
2. Support plenty of authentication providers(OAuth, OpenID, SAML, LDAP)
3. Authorization (ACL) and audit (event)
4. Run-As (Proxy in our dealer POS)
5. A lot more at http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core

What kind of 2nd-factor
1. One-time Password (popular)
2. Others which are easier to implement
